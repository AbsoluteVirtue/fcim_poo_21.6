<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
In this article, we will examine the construct of the Sorted Linear
Hash Table.  Sorted Linear Hash Table is an expandable hash table data
structure with fixed insertion cost.  Two hash tables containing the
same key-value pairs will have identical data traversal order, regardless
of insertion order differences.
</p>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Hash table is a high performance data structure used for data look up.
Key-value pairs can be inserted into the hash table, and given a key, its
associated value can be very quickly retrieved.  
</p>

<p>
A secondary function of the hash table is to produce the key-value pairs
contained in the hash table sequentially.  The traversal ordering refers to
the sequence of key-value pairs that are returned.
</p>

<p>
For two hash tables containing identical key-value pairs, it seems
intuitively that their traversal ordering should be identical.  For hash
tables to be used as values, stable traversal ordering is required.
However, not all hash table implementations support stable traversal ordering.
</p>

<p>
A part of the definition of hash table involves
<a href="inthash.htm">hash function</a>.
A hash function maps a key to an integer.  As key-value pairs are stored in 
array of buckets, this integer determines which bucket the key-value pair
will be stored.
</p>

<p>
Commonly in a simple hash table implementation, the hash table bucket
address is calculated as follows:
</p>

<pre>
bucket_address = hash(key) % hash_table_size;
</pre>

<p>
By taking the remainder of the hash table size, the bucket address is
assured to never exceed the size of hash table.  The bucket is
represented by a linked list of key-value pairs.
</p>

<p>
The simple hash table implementation does not have the capability to
expand its table size.  Each insertion will cause performance degradation
as the table fills up.  To avoid the performance degradation, the hash
table will need to be expanded per each hash table insertion.  The
Sorted Linear Hash Table does this precisely.
</p>



<h2>Sorted Linear Hash Table</h2>

<p>
Linear Hashing was originally developed by W. Litwin in 1980.  Sorted
Linear Hash Table is one version of Linear Hashing.
</p>

<p>
Recall earlier, key-value pairs are stored in an array of key-value lists.
The key-value lists are often called 'buckets'.  The array
index is often mentioned as the 'bucket address'.
</p>

<p>
In Sorted Linear Hash Table, the bucket array size is always
identical to the number of entries in the hash table.  Therefore the
average number of entries per bucket is expected to be 1.
</p>

<p>
Each insertion causes one new bucket added at the end of the array.
Similarly each deletion causes one bucket to be removed at the end of the
array.
</p>

<p>
The bucket array consists of two partitions, the front partition, and
the expansion partition.  The sizes of the front partition are always
powers of 2.  Some valid front partition sizes are 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16...
If a hash table has 7 entries, the front partition size would 4, and
the expansion partition size would be 3.
</p>

<pre>
[ ] are front partition entries.
( ) are expansion partition entries.
The arrow shows the direction for key-value entries splitting.


[0] [1]          Front partition size is 2.  Expansion partition size is 0.


 /-------\
 I       V
[0] [1] (2)      Split from bucket 0 some entries to bucket 2.


     /-------\
     I       V
[0] [1] (2) (3)  Split from bucket 1 some entries to bucket 3.



[0] [1] [2] [3]  Double the front partition.

</pre>

<p>
The bucket address calculation is performed as follows:
</p>

<pre>
if (hash(key) % front_partition_size &gt;= split_from_index)
  bucket_address = hash(key) % front_partition_size;
else
  bucket_address = hash(key) % (2 * front_partition_size);
</pre>

<p>
Looking at the detail of increasing hash table from size 2 to size 3
from the above graph, entries are split from bucket 0 to bucket 2.
All entries in bucket 0 have the property that hash(key) mod 2 equals 0.
Notice that if hash(key) mod 2 is 0, then hash(key) mod 4 must be either
0 or 2.
</p>

<pre>
0 mod 4 = 0
2 mod 4 = 2
4 mod 4 = 0
6 mod 4 = 2
8 mod 4 = 0 ...
</pre>

<p>
So as a result, about half entries remain in bucket 0, half entries are
split off to bucket 2.  This is how splitting works.  For merging, the
operation is the exact reverse of splitting.
</p>

<p>
Key-value entries inside a bucket are sorted by their key comparison
relationship.  This is where the name "Sorted Linear Hash Table" comes
from.
</p>

<p>
The traversal operation consists of looking at each bucket in increasing
order, then travel through each bucket by key sorted order.  For keys
that have well defined comparison functions, the Sorted Linear Hash
Table will ensure there is only one traversal order for a set of keys.
</p>


<h2>Hash Function Selection</h2>

<p>
Since Sorted Linear Hash Table uses front partition with power of 2 sizes,
it is more vulnerable to bad hash function choices.  The article
<a href="primehash.htm#badhash">Prime Double Hash Table</a>
mentions one example of a bad hash function implementation.
Some good hash function construction methods are mentioned in the article
<a href="inthash.htm">Integer Hash Function</a>.
Hash function selection is important, as a bad choice can cause some
collections to hash to only a few buckets.  This condition is hard to
detect as only some data sets would trigger the degenerate behavior.
</p>


<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>
A C++ implementation of the Sorted Linear Hash Table is in the
<a href="/web/20060112115812/http://www.concentric.net/~Ttwang/macro/macrolib.htm">Simple C++ Macro Library</a>.
To instantiate the macro to source code, use the macro processor located
in the article called
<a href="/web/20060112115812/http://www.concentric.net/~Ttwang/macro/macro.htm">Simple C++ Macro Processor</a>.
</p>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
In this article, we presented the design of the Sorted Linear Hash Table.
Sorted Linear Hash Table always produces an unique traversal ordering
for a set of keys.  Sorted Linear Hash Table is a general purpose
hash table data structure with high performance, if the
hash function used is of high quality.
